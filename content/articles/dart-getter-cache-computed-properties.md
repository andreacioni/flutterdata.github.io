title: "Dart Getter Shorthand to Cache Computed Properties"
author: "frank06"
---

An elegant Dart getter shorthand used to cache computed properties:

```dart
T get foo => _foo ??= _computeFoo();

// which depends on having
T _foo;
T _computeFoo() => /** ... **/;
```

It makes use of the fallback assignment operator `??=`.
