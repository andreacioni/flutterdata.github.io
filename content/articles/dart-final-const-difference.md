What's the difference between final and const in Dart?

Easy!

**Final means single-assignment.**

**Const means immutable.**

Let's see an example:

```dart
final _final = [2, 3];
const _const = [2, 3];
_final = [4,5]; // ERROR: can't re-assign
_final.add(6); // OK: can mutate
_const.add(6); // ERROR: can't mutate
```
